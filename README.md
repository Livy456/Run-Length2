# Run-Length2
# Program 1
The first program, decoding string, is a program that receives a String as an input. The program must change the String into a list of all the unique characters and the frequency in which the characters appear in the given String. The list should be the compressed form of the String.

## Example 1
input: "aaabbcgghh"
output: ['a', 3, 'b', 2, 'c', 1, 'g', 2, 'h', 2]

## Example 2
input: "aaabbaaacc"
output: ['a', 3, 'b', 2, 'a', 3, 'c', 2]

# Program 2
The second program, encoding string, is a program that receives a list as an input. The program must change the list into a String of all the characters indicated in the list and match the frequency indicated. The String should be the decompressed form of the list.

## Example 1
input: ['a', 3, 'b', 2, 'c', 1, 'g', 2, 'h', 2]
output: "aaabbcgghh"

## Example 2
input: ['a', 3, 'b', 2, 'a', 3, 'c', 2]
output: "aaabbaaacc"
